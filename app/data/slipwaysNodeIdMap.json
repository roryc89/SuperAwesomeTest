Beyond the black and white marker attached to the wall on the left, the ramp dips dramatically downwards onto the sand. I would approach it very carefully with a 4x4 and certainly not risk it with a front wheel drive car, in the summer dry sand laying on the slip can cause problems even for 4x4's. Recovering a boat at low water can be a problem, there are large rocks at the low water mark and the sand can be very soft and be a problem when recovering a heavier boat. The approach to the harbour slip is through a couple of tight chicane type bends of one vehicle width around various buildings and this is two-way traffic because of the car park above the slip.",

Only difficulty is that very occasionally locals might block access to launch by tying up four abreast. When tide goes out ANDamp; they are on sand it can completely block access to the water.

At low tide the sand adjacent to the ramp is firm and it is possible to recover from the beach when the ramp is busy. This slip is shared with the Southsea Sea Angling Club who are only able to help those who are members of the club (due to insurance limitations). This slip is useable at almost all states if tide, but do not go off the end of the slip at very low spring tides in anything other that a 4 wheel drive vehicle. Countless cars caught out here. Eastney Cruising Association run the two adjacent slipways. The one that launches into the fast moving part of Langstone harbour (often referred to as THE RUN) adjacent to the public slipway, is private and for the use of ECA members only. The one that launches into the part of Langstone Harbour know as 'Eastney Lake' is run by the ECA and does have public access but is tidal and only really useable 1-2 hours either side of high tide. The slips in the main channel are very exposed to south or north winds. The slipway does get covered by shingle following winter storms,the localcouncil are responsible for keeping it clear, but use a contractor who often fails to perform, as a result the slip often has a 18-24\" hump of shingle which is difficult to manoeuvre over as trailer wheels dig in badly.",

There is also chained access to the right of this with no height restrictions. The car park closes at 21.00 and the chain is closed at the discretion of the car park attendant. This is usually weather dependent (17.00 if its raining and 19.00 hr if its fine). However some nights the chain stays open as long as the car park. Oxwich is popular with the weekend crowd who come down on a Friday and either stay at the water side Oxwich Bay Hotel, or any of the hundreds of small guest houses dotted around the Gower. They then use Oxwich as the base for a weekend of sailing or cruising the excellent Gower Peninsula. Facilities at the beach are fairly limited, a shop and toilet block, but miles of uncluttered waters is the reason people go there. The hotel serves good food, and provides reasonably secure parking overnight.",

Amount of manoeuvring space: - Very challenging. There is a boat yard building 10 feet away behind the ramp that can make reversing a little awkward but still possible Crew boarding facility: - Good, from side of slip. Notes: - Only relatively shallow draught yachts are able to use the slip due to the step at the end. It is not possible to get a trailer all the way down and a lifting keel really help here. The yard does have a sling and hoist, so you can get you out if you find that it is impossible to recover via the slip.

The area is busy with walkers and cyclists so take care if you use a rope and expect an audience. Crew boarding facility: - None. Whatever you launch, you will need to wade to get on board. Notes: - Tends to get eroded by the river and roughed up. A popular spot, not particularly crowded. Richmond is half-tidal. A barrier below Richmond holds the level up at low tide so that there is a two hour flood with a neap range of 4½ft and 8½ft at springs. The barrier can be sailed over at high water, at other times you must go through the lock. During the Great River Race in September the slipway is very very busy launching gig boats.

    "Ramp Description": "There are 2 options: Down lifeboat ramp onto beach, or down public ramp (recommended) next to car park onto beach. Public ramp (concrete) is flat and extends over top of beach to the spring high water level only, then you are onto sand. The top 5-10 metres of beach is often soft sand, especially in summer and with neap tides. Loose sand tends to blow and build up. Hard sand in the intertidal zone. 4x4 recommended for anything heavier/ bigger than small sailing dinghy. Occasionally local boat owners with tractors will assist visitors (especially anglers) but cannot rely on this. Launch and recovery easiest for powered boats with 2.0 metres of tidal height (or greater), due to flat seabed at low water, (i.e. use high water +/- 4 or 4½ hours generally). Lifeboat ramp is steep and straight onto soft sand, also used by local cobles, and access around back of lifeboat house is narrow with sharp turns.Note.. Please be aware, after new developement of beach area,I found beach to be very soft and nearly got stuck with a 4X4(april 2008)especially at water level.Please check first",

At 9.30a.m. you are required to recover your boat. In practice, if there is no-one else yet out on the lake or preparing to launch a yacht etc., then a blind eye may be turned to a further period. The staff are very friendly and helpful and, perhaps reassuringly for first-timers like myself, keep an eye on all the lake from their control office. Any problems and they will recover you with one of their RIB's, and a wry smile. This is an excellent way of trying out a boat for the first time.

The slipway is extensively used for the launch and recovery of various wind sailors and kite surfers. Very user friendly ramp leads onto fairly hard sand. Best looked at at low water first to access the channel, kids often throw large boulders in to attempt to block the tide. The River Exe is very unforgiving especially during spring tides. At peak springs you can use the slipway up to 2 ½ hours either side of high water and this is safer than the alternative Mamhead Slip. Please note: The area is a Nature Reserve and SSSI. Beware of disturbance and damage to the beach. Driving or parking is not encouraged on the beach. Local byelaws will be enforced against drivers posing a nuisance or danger to beach users. 10 Knot speed limit off the slipway and out to the Safe Water Mark.",

There's a narrow open access alongside the gate, too small for any trailer, but OK for kayaks etc. You can never launch directly off the slipway, and there is soft sand then shingle to cross before reaching firmer stuff lower down the beach. So you need a key and a 4x4 for anything on a trailer, even then it can be tricky, according to beach, sea and tide conditions. Warm summer days mean picking a safe route through sunbathers and children playing on the beach, and there's often kids in the water right where you launch, so please paddle clear before starting the engine.",

The slip is concrete and the supervisors will help if required. In general, the Supervisors were extremely helpful, cheerful and friendly. Warning! At the end of the concrete slip a step has developed over the winter and care needs to be taken during spring tides.",
    "Directions": "Entering Falmouth, follow the signs for the main DOCKS area. This will take you around the back of Falmouth town. Falmouth is composed of small streets and pedestrian areas which are inadvisable with a boat and trailer. Once at the dock entrance, take the road back towards town for approximately 1/3rd. mile. Go past mini roundabout and look for the entrance on your right after 100yds. If you see Trago Mills, you've gone past it. In front there is a dinghy storage compound and the gate is just prior to this. Once in, go straight forward to the Supervisors cabin which juts out from the end of the building on your left.",

Once launched, it is advisable to moor up in the marina across to the east of the harbour. This is gated and secure with toilets and showers and is also run by the Falmouth Haven. Mooring fees apply. There is a petrol/diesel pontoon on the marina with unleaded at £1.83 per litre.",
    "Cruising Area": "Flushings, the river Fal all the way up to Truro, all creeks and rivers around there. Out to sea towards Penzance and the Helford River or East to Portscatho etc.. Plenty of waterside pubs by the river(Inevitably thatched) with good food available. Lots of river wildife, especially Herons and Egrets. If you do go up to Truro, keep at eye on the tide, the landing stage is at the side of the inner ring road and Tesco's. Not very attractive but there is a good view of the Cathedral as you enter the harbour.",
    "Navigational Hazards": "The river Fal is tidal and can catch you out if you don't read the free set of tide tables given at the slip. If you want to go to Truro, the ferry times are a very good guide. There are times it doesn't go all the way so obviously avoid the same times. The river is bouyed for the deeper channel, but following the ferry all the way to Truro is an important navigational learning curve for spotting a decent course. Within Truro harbour you MUST follow the bouys correctly. A depth finder is invaluable in a tidal river such as this. Speed limits in the harbour and up the river. These are on a free sticker given when you launch and are 5, 8 AND 10 knots respectively although there are waterskiing areas in the southern reaches of the river. Once clear of the harbour at Falmouth there are no speed limits. There is a chain-driven ferry half-way up the Fal. The King Harry Ferry. When it is moving, the front chains raise in the water. Cross only behind it or when it is at rest."

Surface of manoeuvring area: - Tarmac roadway. Amount of manoeuvring space: - Good, a road junction is close to the slipway. Crew boarding facility: - Unknown. Notes: - The Ajax Sea Scouts are based next to the slipway (though do not have priority over it) and are often busy with a lot of children in canoes etc, so if they are there when you arrive to launch or recover it may be worth telling them so that they can keep their people out of the way.

Built into the staithe from the Parish boat park. No vehicle access. Small winches are provided to help with launching and recovery. Underwater gradient: - Approx 1:4 What’s at the end: - There is a step at the end. Surface AND quality of vehicle manoeuvring area: - Adequate coarse gravel. Amount of manoeuvring space: - Very challenging, you may have to unhitch to manoeuvre. Crew boarding facility: - Remove your trailer, pull the boat back into the slip and use the wharf in the slip cutting. Notes: - There are two Public Slipways opposite each other here on a short narrow spur of the Broad! Both owned by the Parish council, with access directly onto Hickling Broad and paddles downstream to Horsey, Martham, Somerton AND Potter Heigham. You have to unhitch boat trailer and use the staithe`s winch to launch and recover. An old guy from parish comes up on a quad bike to collect £4 fee from non-parishioners and helps sometimes with winch, and if you get to know him you can put money on his boat. Can be a bit tight for space to launch and recover with boats moored opposite slipway. Often so busy in summer it can be difficult to temporarily moor up while sorting out car and trailer.",

These boats are probably the biggest that I can handle on my own. The particular nature of this seabord - very low-lying and flat - permits small craft to come ashore almost anywhere (the dories of the region are called 'pontons') which is reassuring should an emergency develope.

Type: - Excellent concrete slipway built alongside the bank in a corner of the marina basin. (Photo below) Slipway useable width: - 6 Mts. Length of the slope above the water: - 12 Mts. Drop to the water: - 60 cm. Therefore gradient above the water: - 1:20 Length of the slope below the water: - 28+ Mts. Depth at the end of the underwater slope: - 1.4+ Mts.

Watch that you don't park to close that you block entrance but all in it looks great for a free slip and parking, Used this slip Friday 23/8/13. Launched my Shetland 535 1hr before high tide with some difficulty. Bottom at end of slip is very flat with washed up sand etc. Tried to retrieve at High tide. Outboard skeg grounded before mate could jump off bow to get trailer, THEN - as slip area is open to the sea (on the right looking out) my boat was washed onto the stony/rocky beach. Had to get a berth in Marina overnight, going to motor to Broughty ferry for a safe retrieve today if not too rough. Further info: There is no jetty to tie up to or board passengers/gear.Should be OK for Jet Skis and small dinghy or inflatables",

Slipway useable width varies: - 2.5 Mts at the top, widening to 2.7 Mts halfway down, and 2.75 Mts at the bottom. The slope above the water also varies: - The first 5 Mts drops 30cm, steepening for 5 Mts to drop a further 70cm. Total drop to the water: - 1 Mtr. Gradient above the water: - Final section 1:7 Length of the slope below the water: - 6 Mts. Depth at the end of the underwater slope: - 0.85 Mts Underwater gradient: - 1:7 Length of any level bed after the slope: - 6 Mts. What’s at the end of the concrete: - Sudden drop into mud, level with the edge of the wharf. Quality AND surface of vehicle manoeuvring area: - Good quality compacted gravel AND grit. Amount of long trailer manoeuvring space: - Quite easy. Crew boarding facility: - Remove your trailer, keep the boat in the slip cutting and use as a wharf. Quality of boarding facility: - Excellent. Height above the water: - 30cm Distance for carrying portable boats: - Depends on where you think it best to launch, nearest point would be the bottom of the slipway at about 12 Mts. Notes: - There are two slipways; the nearest to the gate is available for trailed craft. The other is for narrowboat maintenance. With the slipway being narrow you need to be a skilled driver to avoid your trailer or car scraping the deep sides of the cutting. A centrally mounted front hitch would be very useful.

Quality, surface, and description of boat carrying route: - Excellent meadow grass area. The photo below was taken from the asphalt drive, so if there are no boats moored here you need only reverse a little way onto the grass. However if there is a boat there and the ground is firm, drive down to the far end of the grass by the boat turning area. Otherwise you will have to find some other wharf space with a bigger drop, but there is plenty of choice. Notes: - If you zoom in to Google Maps and switch to ‘satellite view’ you will notice they caught a fete in progress. If you want to use this site best ring the pub and make sure there’s not another one pending!",
