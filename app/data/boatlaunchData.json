Quite narrow and very difficult to launch even a 14 foot fishing boat due to a very sharp turn required at the top. No water during neap tides, need at least 4.7 metre tides to launch. Using a four wheel drive vehicle is risky since parts of the muddy area is deep and high possibility of cutting tyres on the slate and rocks. For smaller boats that can be wheeled manually, there is another narrow ramp at right angles to the main ramp which has water for at least half of the neap tides. Some sand/mud has to be crossed to reach this but this is quite firm. No vehicles should venture down the slipway, as it gets very muddy very quickly!

Notes: - Only relatively shallow draught yachts are able to use the slip due to the step at the end. It is not possible to get a trailer all the way down and a lifting keel really help here. The yard does have a sling and hoist, so you can get you out if you find that it is impossible to recover via the slip.

Wheel clamps, or other trailer securings are: - Desirable if you have any and use a trailer, although storage is good and secure. Parking period limits: - The gate to the slip is locked at 5pm so you have to be out and gone by then or arrange to leave boat moored overnight (car parking area is outside of barrier)",
                    "Suitability for canoes, dinghies, small inflatables, other portable boats with paddles; and RIB\u2019s, heavy dinghies, small yachts and other low height boats with engines: - Adequate. (Launched a 19ft boat OK, not suitable for boats that are much longer due to proximity of buildings to the end of the the slip. Boatyard owner very approachable and was happy to advise on best launch tactic).",

Fixed deep keel boats should keep near the post markers in the centre of the broad. There is a good car park (public) behind the pub as well as public toilets that are well maintained.

Another option for campers/tourers is to stay at Searls Holiday Camp and get day/weekend/weekly membership from there and this gets you even more.....you can use Searles facilities and the clubs, (Hunstanton and District Watersports Club)",

Public ramp (concrete) is flat and extends over top of beach to the spring high water level only, then you are onto sand. The top 5-10 metres of beach is often soft sand, especially in summer and with neap tides. Loose sand tends to blow and build up. Hard sand in the intertidal zone. 4x4 recommended for anything heavier/ bigger than small sailing dinghy. Occasionally local boat owners with tractors will assist visitors (especially anglers) but cannot rely on this. Launch and recovery easiest for powered boats with 2.0 metres of tidal height (or greater), due to flat seabed at low water, (i.e. use high water +/- 4 or 4\u00bd hours generally). Lifeboat ramp is steep and straight onto soft sand, also used by local cobles, and access around back of lifeboat house is narrow with sharp turns.Note..

There are times it doesn't go all the way so obviously avoid the same times. The river is bouyed for the deeper channel, but following the ferry all the way to Truro is an important navigational learning curve for spotting a decent course. Within Truro harbour you MUST follow the bouys correctly. A depth finder is invaluable in a tidal river such as this. Speed limits in the harbour and up the river. These are on a free sticker given when you launch and are 5, 8 AND 10 knots respectively although there are waterskiing areas in the southern reaches of the river. Once clear of the harbour at Falmouth there are no speed limits. There is a chain-driven ferry half-way up the Fal. The King Harry Ferry. When it is moving, the front chains raise in the water. Cross only behind it or when it is at rest."

Built into the staithe from the Parish boat park. No vehicle access. Small winches are provided to help with launching and recovery. Underwater gradient: - Approx 1:4 What\u2019s at the end: - There is a step at the end. Surface AND quality of vehicle manoeuvring area: - Adequate coarse gravel. Amount of manoeuvring space: - Very challenging, you may have to unhitch to manoeuvre. Crew boarding facility: - Remove your trailer, pull the boat back into the slip and use the wharf in the slip cutting. Notes: - There are two Public Slipways opposite each other here on a short narrow spur of the Broad! Both owned by the Parish council, with access directly onto Hickling Broad and paddles downstream to Horsey, Martham, Somerton AND Potter Heigham. You have to unhitch boat trailer and use the staithe`s winch to launch and recover. An old guy from parish comes up on a quad bike to collect \u00a34 fee from non-parishioners and helps sometimes with winch, and if you get to know him you can put money on his boat. Can be a bit tight for space to launch and recover with boats moored opposite slipway. Often so busy in summer it can be difficult to temporarily moor up while sorting out car and trailer.",

The warm 'Marin' wind blows mist AND rain onshore and this too can last for a day or two. These patterns are changing however: more light-wind days, and shorter 'blows'. The next ramp south is at St.Pierre marina(6km) passing long sandy beaches. Gruissan port AND lagoon is a further 8km. Harbour-hopping and lagoon-cruising could take you pleasantly and safely all the way up or down this coast. The Aude river is 80m. wide here - up-river there's little to see or do apart from fishing and swimming. Heavy rain can raise the level and force considerably.",

My experience however comes from living here and making frequent visits over 12 years in all seasons.This year we plan to get a Drascombe Lugger or Longboat - thus my researches have focused on the ramps and slipways of the area. These boats are probably the biggest that I can handle on my own. The particular nature of this seabord - very low-lying and flat - permits small craft to come ashore almost anywhere (the dories of the region are called 'pontons') which is reassuring should an emergency develope. I welcome enquiries and corrections. Also note: covered,secure overwintering is available for a limited number of boats.",

Type: - Excellent concrete slipway built alongside the bank in a corner of the marina basin. (Photo below) Slipway useable width: - 6 Mts. Length of the slope above the water: - 12 Mts. Drop to the water: - 60 cm. Therefore gradient above the water: - 1:20 Length of the slope below the water: - 28+ Mts. Depth at the end of the underwater slope: - 1.4+ Mts. Therefore underwater gradient: - 1:20 (May give severe launching and retrieving problems) What's at the end of the concrete: - It's uncertain where the concrete ends and the mud starts. Quality and surface of vehicle manoeuvring area: - Good loose gravel AND grit. Amount of trailer manoeuvring space: - Ample. Type of crew boarding facility AND quality: - Excellent wood or plastic jetty entirely on piers. Height above the water: - 40 cm. Distance for carrying portable boats: - If you are lucky you may be able to unload your boat and lower it straight onto the water on the slipway ramp, otherwise about 10 Mts. Notes: - This slipway slope is designed for narrowboats. You will need to tie your boat rope to the trailer or pass it to crew on the jetty. Reversing some distance into the water and braking hard to slide the boat off should work. For retrieving you will need to wear waders or get your feet wet. They have a caf\u00e9 on site in case you are in need of an ice cream after your launch or recovery efforts. (Have a look for yourself, zoom in on the map above and switch to satellite view)",

The slipway is mainly used by the Marina workshop to move narrowboats onto dry ground for hull maintenance. Launching is probably best done by removing boat securings, passing the bow line to crew ashore, reversing the trailer and vehicle slowly into the water and breaking hard.

Then comes a pronounced hump as the slipway descends steeply for a further 3.2 Mts down to water level. (To my surprise the trailer for my 7 Mtr boat cleared this without grounding) (Photo\u2019s below) Surface of the slipway: - Concrete ~ built onto the bank. Slipway useable width: - 4 Mts Length of the slope above the water: - 3.2 Mts Slipway gradient above the water: - 1:5 Length of the slope below the water: - 7.5 Mts Depth at the end of the underwater slope: - 1 Mtr Underwater gradient: - 1:7 Length of any level concrete ramp after the slope: - None. What\u2019s at the end: - It\u2019s uncertain where the concrete ends and the mud starts. Surface AND quality of vehicle manoeuvring area: - Excellent tarmac turning place outside the reception office and then a short, straight 3 Mtr wide concrete reversing passage alongside reception down to the slipway. Amount of manoeuvring space: - Sufficient. Crew boarding facility: - Wharf on the port side, wood plank landing on the starboard side. Wharf height above the water: - 40cm Notes: - When you slip the boat into the water take care to keep it under good control as there are projections on the adjacent walkway which could cause cabin damage. Owned by ABC Leisure, the Marina is the base for a large hire fleet, so try to avoid asking to use the slipway on Saturday as this is changeover day. It\u2019s available between 8.00 am to 5.00 pm weekdays and at weekends. (Have a look for yourself on Google maps \u2013 Street view, but note the access drive to the slipway is not visible)",

Slipway useable width varies: - 2.5 Mts at the top, widening to 2.7 Mts halfway down, and 2.75 Mts at the bottom. The slope above the water also varies: - The first 5 Mts drops 30cm, steepening for 5 Mts to drop a further 70cm. Total drop to the water: - 1 Mtr. Gradient above the water: - Final section 1:7 Length of the slope below the water: - 6 Mts. Depth at the end of the underwater slope: - 0.85 Mts Underwater gradient: - 1:7 Length of any level bed after the slope: - 6 Mts. What\u2019s at the end of the concrete: - Sudden drop into mud, level with the edge of the wharf. Quality AND surface of vehicle manoeuvring area: - Good quality compacted gravel AND grit. Amount of long trailer manoeuvring space: - Quite easy. Crew boarding facility: - Remove your trailer, keep the boat in the slip cutting and use as a wharf. Quality of boarding facility: - Excellent. Height above the water: - 30cm Distance for carrying portable boats: - Depends on where you think it best to launch, nearest point would be the bottom of the slipway at about 12 Mts. Notes: - There are two slipways; the nearest to the gate is available for trailed craft. The other is for narrowboat maintenance. With the slipway being narrow you need to be a skilled driver to avoid your trailer or car scraping the deep sides of the cutting. A centrally mounted front hitch would be very useful.
